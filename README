Alpenblumen (mountain/alpine flowers) is a tiny game by Benjamin Newman.

Inspired by Mark Brown's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZzcVs8tNfE&)
on the development of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which mentions the
"triangle rule" -- mountains on the horizon are triangles which occlude
what's beyond them, you can go over or around them to see what's beyond --
I tried to come up with the simplest, game-jam-sized game that would use
that idea.  Alpenblumen is the result.

The game is packaged as a single Java class file.  You'll need a Java
runtime to run it.

Use the arrow keys to navigate.  Use the spacebar to pick flowers.
You can hold two flowers in your inventory.  When you pick a flower
that matches one in your inventory, both are cleared and you score
a point.  Score all pairs of flowers to complete the game.  Close
the window to exit.
